2 way v 3 way merge
-------------------

2 way: Just merge 2 arbitrary different files into one file

  - but for each difference, who changed it? E.g. was that line changed in both files, or just in one? Which one should we keep?
  
  3 way: the 2 files, plus the "base common ancestor"
  
  - then you can see who changed what (as in in which places the 2 new files have been changed), and therefore what to keep
