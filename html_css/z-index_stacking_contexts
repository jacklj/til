Z-index Stacking Contexts
-------------------------
stacking contexts = groups of elements with a common parent that are confined to a particular place in the stacking order

Stacking contexts are formed when:
1. an elements is the root element of the document (<html>)
2. when position: anything but static and z-index != auto
3. when an element has opacity < 1

This is why sometimes no matter what you put an elements z-index, it doesn't do what you want.

P.S. z-index only works on positioned elements
