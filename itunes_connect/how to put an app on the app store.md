- on the iTunes Connect website, go to the the App Store tab
- in the navigation column on the left, under the "iOS APP" heading, you can see the list of app versions currently waiting for sending for review, under review, having been reviewed, and successfully published versions
- if the top version isn't the latest version you distributed (ie you can see the latest version in the TestFlight tab, but not in the App Store tab), then:
    - click on the latest version you can see in the App Store tab
    - scroll down to the 'Build' section, **mouseover the version of the app there, and a red delete/remove button will appear - click it** (it's hidden unless you mouseover it)
    - you can then choose the desired version of the app you want to submit instead.
